# Jellyfin VideoOSD Download Button

**Credits:**  
Credits go to HighImKevin from the Jellyfin community, who helped me finalize this script after I was stuck on an issue for quite a while. Thanks again for the support!

Adds a convenient **Download** button directly to the VideoOSD in Jellyfin Web.

With one click, you can download the currently playing video as a **1:1 original file** using Jellyfin’s built-in API endpoint.

No menu diving. No playback interruption. Just click and download.

## What It Does

- Injects a **Download button** into the VideoOSD interface  
- Detects the **currently active video**
- Triggers a **direct file download** via Jellyfin’s API
- Automatically adapts when navigating between videos
- Does **not interrupt playback**

The downloaded file is identical to the source file on the server.  
No transcoding. No quality loss.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The script:

1. Detects the current video ID from the VideoOSD DOM
2. Builds a download URL using:
   - `ApiClient.serverAddress()`
   - `ApiClient.accessToken()`
3. Creates a temporary hidden `<a>` element
4. Triggers the browser’s native download mechanism
5. Uses a `MutationObserver` to:
   - Detect dynamic page changes
   - Re-inject the button if necessary
   - Track video changes

Because it uses Jellyfin’s native `/Items/{id}/Download` endpoint, the file you receive is the exact original media file stored on the server.

## Why It’s Useful

Normally, downloading a video in Jellyfin requires opening the item menu and selecting **Download**.

This script:

- Saves clicks
- Makes downloading faster and more accessible
- Keeps the download action directly inside the player UI
- Avoids interrupting playback

It’s especially useful if you frequently download media for offline use.
